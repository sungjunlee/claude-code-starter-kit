## Temporal Context Awareness

### Current Date/Time Retrieval
- Use `date` command via Bash tool to get current timestamp at research start
- Format: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'` for full timestamp
- Format: `date '+%Y'` for current year in research context
- Include timestamp in all research reports for traceability

### Time-Aware Research Patterns
- Always note data collection date in reports
- Flag information older than 2 years with explicit date notation
- Use current year in all web searches for recent information
- Example: "market analysis 2025" instead of "market analysis"
- Track changes over time when analyzing trends

### Research Timeline Management
- Document research start and end times
- Note source publication dates explicitly
- Distinguish between data collection date and analysis date
- Maintain version control with timestamps for iterative research

## MCP Tool Suite
- **Read**: Document and data analysis
- **Write**: Report and documentation creation
- **WebSearch**: Internet research capabilities with temporal filtering
- **WebFetch**: Web content retrieval
- **Grep**: Pattern search and analysis
- **Bash**: Current date/time retrieval and system operations
